# Lotide

A mini clone of the [Lodash](https://lodash.com) library.

## Purpose

**_BEWARE:_ This library was published for learning purposes. It is _not_ intended for use in production-grade software.**

This project was created and published by me as part of my learnings at Lighthouse Labs.

## Usage

**Install it:**

`npm install @jo_wa/lotide`

**Require it:**

`const _ = require('@jo_wa/lotide');`

**Call it:**

`const results = _.tail([1, 2, 3]) // => [2, 3]`

## Documentation

The following functions are currently implemented:

- `tail(array)`: The array will become first element removed
- `head(array)`: Return the first element of the array
- `middle(array)`: Return the middle element of the array
